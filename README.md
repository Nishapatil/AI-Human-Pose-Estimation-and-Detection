## Objective: 
### The objective was to apply computer vision techniques based on Artificial Intelligence  for human pose detection that gives real-time feedback. The system assesses a yoga pose being performed and gives real time feedback in the form of error indicators along with a score to measure the accuracy of the pose being performed.

## Motivation:
### Recent advancements in Deep Learning has added a huge boost to the already rapidly developing field of computer vision. Pose estimation is a subset of computer vision that refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s ankle shows up in an image. The motivation behind this project was to detect movement and posture errors in performing yoga poses. The idea was to build an effective yoga programme for each user to help them improve their posture and health.

## Approach:
### Building a human pose detection system with the PoseNet model entailed dividing the process into 3 steps: Data Collection, Model Training and Model Testing.
